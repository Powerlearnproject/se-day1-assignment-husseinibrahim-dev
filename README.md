Planning helps to ensure that the project is viable and sets a clear roadmap for development.

2. Requirements Analysis
Description: In this phase, the specific needs and requirements of the software are gathered and documented. This involves understanding what the users need from the software and defining both functional and non-functional requirements. Clear and thorough requirements analysis is crucial for guiding the design and development phases.

3. Design
Description: The design phase focuses on creating the architecture of the software. This includes designing the overall system architecture, defining data models, and detailing the user interfaces and components. The design serves as a blueprint for the development phase, ensuring that all parts of the system work together cohesively.

4. Implementation (or Development)
Description: During the implementation phase, the actual code is written based on the design specifications. Developers translate the design into a working software product, creating the necessary algorithms, databases, and user interfaces. This is typically the most time-consuming phase of the SDLC.

5. Testing
Description: The testing phase involves systematically checking the software for defects or bugs. Various testing methods, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT), are used to ensure that the software meets the requirements and is free of critical errors.

6. Deployment
Description: After successful testing, the software is deployed to the production environment, where it becomes available to users. This phase includes activities like installation, configuration, and ensuring that the software operates smoothly in its intended environment.

7. Maintenance
Description: Once the software is deployed, it enters the maintenance phase, where it is monitored for any issues that arise in the real-world environment. This phase involves fixing bugs, making necessary updates, and adding new features over time to keep the software functional and relevant.

These phases of the SDLC provide a framework for developing software in a systematic and organized manner, helping to ensure that the final product meets user needs and performs reliably.

Explanation of the Improved Prompt:
Specificity: The improved prompt narrows the focus to a specific area of technology—artificial intelligence—and asks about key advancements within a defined timeframe (the past five years). This directs the AI to provide a more targeted and relevant response.

Clear Context: By mentioning specific industries (healthcare and finance), the prompt provides context, guiding the AI to discuss how AI advancements have impacted these particular sectors. This avoids broad or general answers that may not be useful.

Conciseness: The improved prompt is clear and to the point, minimizing ambiguity. It ensures the AI understands exactly what information is being requested, reducing the chances of an irrelevant or incomplete response.

Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:

Focused Output: The improved prompt guides the AI to focus on a specific topic (AI advancements) and context (industry impact), leading to a more informative and detailed response.

Relevance: By specifying industries and a timeframe, the user ensures the response will be more aligned with their interests or needs, making it immediately useful.

Efficiency: A clear, specific prompt reduces the need for follow-up questions or clarifications, making the interaction more efficient and productive.

In essence, the improved prompt enhances the quality and relevance of the AI's output by clearly defining the user's expectations and the scope of the response.
